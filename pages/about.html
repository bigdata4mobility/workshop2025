            <h2>Big Data, AI & Transportation Planning Applications Workshop</h2>
            <p>May 30, 2025 @ University of Washington Seattle</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
        <p>The field of transportation planning is tasked with three tall orders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. providing an accurate picture of the nation's or a region's travel patterns;</li>
            <li>2. predicting future travel demands; and</li>
            <li>3. making policy recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For decades, the field has relied upon household travel surveys, supplemented with count data
            (either from sensors or manual counts).
            Travel demand forecasting has also evolved from simple (and still widely used) four-step models
            to activity-based models that seek to model individuals' entire travel days with advanced econometric
            models. </p>
        <p>Both (data and methods) are now undergoing unprecedented transformations.
            On the data, the last 10 years have seen a surge of studies using passively-generated,
            location-based-service (LBS) data to understand, evaluate and model human mobility patterns.
            On the methods, the rise of deep neural networks and generative AI has opened new promises for
            the field of demand forecasting. </p>
        <p>This workshop gathers researchers from civil engineering, urban planning,
            economics, and computer science whose work is in the frontiers of transportation planning,
            either from a data or a method perspective. </p>

        <h3>The goals of the workshop are: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Provide a snapshot of cutting edge works in the field;</li>
            <li>2. Identify research gaps and point out future directions; and</li>
            <li>3. Identify concrete steps for the community to take on and tackle. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When and Where</h2>
        <p>The workshop will be held at the University of Washington in Seattle WA.</p>
