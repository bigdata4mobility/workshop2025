                    fast growing AI technologies. Dr. Fan will use examples to demonstrate how domain knowledge, when
                    incorporated across steps like data selection and model design, may help improve the effectiveness
                    and interpretability of AI models. Dr. Fan will also discuss barriers that need community-level
                    efforts to foster collaboration between domain experts and AI practitioners. The goal is to ignite a
                    conversation about how domain expertise can drive innovation and enhance the impact of AI in solving
                    pressing transportation challenges.</td>

                <td>Household Travel Survey (HTS) data is commonly used in activity-based models but faces limitations
                    such as infrequent collection and low spatial heterogeneity. Passively Collected Mobility (PCM) data
                    addresses these shortcomings by offering greater spatial and temporal coverage but lacks several key
                    attributes. This talk discusses analytical non-parametric approaches to integrate HTS and PCM data,
                    ensuring that the rich distributions of variables from each dataset are preserved in the fused
                    representation of sociodemographic profiles and daily activity schedules. The case studies will
                    demonstrate how spatiotemporally heterogeneous digital mobility twins can be generated by harnessing
                    HTS data with cellular trace data and transit smart card data for Singapore and Seoul, South Korea.

                    understanding how such models can help in urban contexts is no exception. In this talk, Dr. Luca
                    will go through some studies exploring how to leverage foundation models as tools to deal with some
                    challenges related to mobility. For instance, it will explore how language models can be used to
                    predict the future whereabouts of individuals and aggregate demand prediction even in data-scarce
                    scenarios. Similarly, it will explore how such language models can perform text-based generation of
                    mobility and how realistic such trajectories can be.

                <td>With the availability of various data sources across all modes of transportation systems, it remains
                    a challenge how to take advantage of those diverse spatio-temporal data to best understand travel
                    patterns across those modes in high spatio-temporal resolutions. In a mesoscopic network modeling
                    framework, Dr. Qian formulate and solve for spatio-temporal passenger and vehicular flows in a
                    multi-modal network explicitly considering solo-driving, public transit, parking, curb use and
                    ride-sharing. Through a computational graph approach, the travel behavior models and network
                    characteristics can be jointly learned from a generic set of data, e.g. time-varying counts, speeds,
                    census, transit data, and curb use data. Machine learning (ML) techniques are employed to optimally
                    tune generic parameters to fit the multi-source data. This framework has been applied in many use
                    cases for regions, cities and communities to make optimal decisions in transportation planning. The
                    mesoscopic modeling approach can also be applied to real-time traffic operations, particularly early
                    anomaly detection and proactive traffic management.

                <td style="font-style:italic">Statistical modeling of transportation inverse problems</td>
                <td>Transportation is a domain where many challenging inverse problems exist. A signature problem is to
                    estimate origin-destination matrix from link traffic counts. Addressing these problems is crucial
                    for planners and operators, yet traditional iterative approaches often encounter identifiability
                    issues or incorrect local optimal. The problem becomes even more challenging when considering the
                    time-varying nature of the demand. In this talk, Dr. Sun will walk through two real-world inverse
                    problems faced by public transit operations: (1) route choice and flow assignment in a metro network
                    with only travel time observations, and (2) time-varying origin-destination matrix estimation with
                    only boarding/alighting counts. Dr. Sun will show how Bayesian statistics can be used to effectively
                    tackle the problems and derive the posterior distributions of any quantities/variables of interest.
                    Furthermore, Dr. Sun will emphasize the significance of probabilistic modeling and uncertainty
                    quantification in enhancing the robustness of downstream decision-making processes.</td>

                <td>Urban economic resilience hinges on understanding how shocks propagate across local businesses and
                    amenities during pandemics, disasters, and technological shifts. While disruptions in supply chains
                    have been extensively studied, it is imperative to recognize that human behavior changes may also
                    amplify shocks to businesses and amenities that are connected via mobility and lifestyle patterns.
                    In this talk, Dr. Yabe will present data-driven spatial network models to predict the cascades
                    of shocks across cities, and further discuss applications to optimize civil infrastructure systems
                    to achieve urban resilience. Dr. Yabe will also discuss his ongoing research on cross-city transfer
                    learning approaches to prepare cities for unprecedented shocks.

                <td>This talk explores the potential of leveraging LLM agents to advance activity-based modeling of
                    travel demand. Traditional agent-based simulations rely on hardcoded condition-action rules for
                    agents to schedule daily activities and make travel plans. These agents adapt and interact within
                    dynamic environments but are constrained by predefined behavioral assumptions. Dr. Yin proposes
                    replacing these agents with LLM agents that use large language models as reasoning engines. Unlike
                    traditional agents, LLM agents derive decision rules from the parametric knowledge embedded in the
                    LLM, eliminating the need for manual rule-coding. This paradigm shift could enhance activity-based
                    microsimulation by relaxing behavioral assumptions, reducing data requirements, and offering greater
                    flexibility to evaluate innovative plans and policies.</td>

                    and Location Data</td>
                <td>Household travel survey data have long been essential for analyzing travel behavior. While valuable,
                    these data face major limitations, including high data collection costs, small sample sizes, and
                    insufficient spatial details about trips. Mobile device location data, on the other hand, have
                    recently gained attention in transportation planning. They provide large-scale, granular travel
                    trajectories at a low cost but lack critical traveler information, such as sociodemographics and
                    preferences/attitudes. This talk introduces a novel Generative AI framework that integrates
                    household travel survey data with mobile device location data. By combining their strengths, this
                    approach addresses existing limitations and paves the way for next-generation transportation
