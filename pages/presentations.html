                    addresses these shortcomings by offering greater spatial and temporal coverage but lacks several key

                    representation of sociodemographic profiles and daily activity schedules. The case studies will

                    HTS data with cellular trace data and transit smart card data for Singapore and Seoul, South Korea.

                    patterns across those modes in high spatio-temporal resolutions. In a mesoscopic network modeling
                    framework, Dr. Qian formulate and solve for spatio-temporal passenger and vehicular flows in a
                    multi-modal network explicitly considering solo-driving, public transit, parking, curb use and
                    ride-sharing. Through a computational graph approach, the travel behavior models and network
                    characteristics can be jointly learned from a generic set of data, e.g. time-varying counts, speeds,
                    census, transit data, and curb use data. Machine learning (ML) techniques are employed to optimally
                    tune generic parameters to fit the multi-source data. This framework has been applied in many use
                    cases for regions, cities and communities to make optimal decisions in transportation planning. The
                    mesoscopic modeling approach can also be applied to real-time traffic operations, particularly early

                <td>This talk explores the potential of leveraging LLM agents to advance activity-based modeling of
                    travel demand. Traditional agent-based simulations rely on hardcoded condition-action rules for
                    agents to schedule daily activities and make travel plans. These agents adapt and interact within
                    dynamic environments but are constrained by predefined behavioral assumptions. Dr. Yin proposes
                    replacing these agents with LLM agents that use large language models as reasoning engines. Unlike
                    traditional agents, LLM agents derive decision rules from the parametric knowledge embedded in the
                    LLM, eliminating the need for manual rule-coding. This paradigm shift could enhance activity-based
                    microsimulation by relaxing behavioral assumptions, reducing data requirements, and offering greater
                    flexibility to evaluate innovative plans and policies.</td>
